                                **************

  The COMPUTRON 3000 project is an effort to create a retro computing platform
  around the Z80 8 bit micro processor to toy and experiment with
  never-was-state-of-the-art hardware.

  It is currently still in an early state, but the existing schematics should
  (theoretically) already yield something working.

  The text below is (for now) just a random assortment of ideas that should be
  writted down somewhere.
