 libz80 - Z80 emulation library
=============================================================================
(C) Gabriel Gambetta (gabriel.gambetta@gmail.com) 2000 - 2012
Version 2.1.0

Emulation code itself is generated by the codegen folder. mktables.spec
includes a specification of the opcodes, using regular expressions to express
similar opcodes in a compact way. Binary representation of the opcodes is
listed in opcodes.lst. This makes tweaking the 'processor' relatively easy, as
it isn't done manually.
