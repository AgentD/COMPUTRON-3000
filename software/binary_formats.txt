        Required Symbol Table:
            for each UNRESOLVED sybmol in code:
                offset from beginning of file-> 16 bit little endian
                type                         -> 8 bit: 0=16 bit big endian,
                                                       1=16 bit lil endian,
                                                       2=lowbyte,
                                                       3=highbyte
                name of symbol               -> '\0' terminated ASCII string

        Exported Symbol Table:
            for each EXPORTED sybmol in code:
                offset from beginning of file-> 16 bit little endian
                name of symbol               -> '\0' terminated ASCII string

        Relocation Table:
            for each ABSOLUTE ADDRESS RESOLVED sybmol in code:
                offset from beginning of file-> 16 bit little endian
                resolved value of symbol     -> 16 bit little endian
                type                         -> 8 bit: 0=16 bit big endian,
                                                       1=16 bit lil endian,
                                                       2=lowbyte,

            export table start           -> 16 bit little endian
            relocation table start       -> 16 bit little endian
            number of symbols required   -> 16 bit little endian
            number of symbols exported   -> 16 bit little endian
            number of relocation entries -> 16 bit little endian
